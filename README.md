## Indicators

### 1. human development index (HDI)

#### **Description** 

http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi

**Data source** - http://hdr.undp.org/en/data

The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should  be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national  policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per  capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These  contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.
 The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average  achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy  life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI  is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three  dimensions.

The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the  education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of  school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by  gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income,  to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a  composite index using geometric mean. Refer to [Technical notes](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2020_technical_notes.pdf) for more details.

The HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development  entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security,  empowerment, etc. The HDRO offers the other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality,  gender disparity and poverty.
